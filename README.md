# coin_change
Given a value of N,if we want to make change for N cents,we have infinite supply of each of S={s1,s2,.....,sn} valued coins.
We have to find the number of ways of making the change.
Eg:
N=4, S={1,2,3}
                                      S{1,2,3}
                                 /     |     |     \
                           {1,1,1,1} {1,3}  {2,2}   {1,1,2}
So the number of ways we can change the coins=4
